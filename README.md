# Intro
This page describes information about Qest web.

# Web
- two environments: development and production
- current URLs:
  - development: https://dev.web.qestapp.net
  - production: https://web.qestapp.net
- git: https://dev.azure.com/qest/Qest/_git/qest-web-react-2.0
- PR pipeline (trigger when master branch change): https://dev.azure.com/qest/Qest/_build?definitionId=241
- Release pipeline (trigger when master branch change for deploy dev, prod has to be approved): https://dev.azure.com/qest/Qest/_release?_a=releases&view=mine&definitionId=124
- framework: Next.js
- language: TypeScript
- type: static web - build at CICD

## Web AWS architecture
- project is built at CICD and deployed into AWS S3 bucket (with CloudFront - CDN)
- during build is fetched GraphQL data from CMS and builded as statics HTMLs
- CICD also during release create invalidation of CDN (html and images)
- infrastructure is written at AWS CDK tool (infrastructure as code)
- current AWS stack:
  - s3 for storing static web HTMLs
  - cloud front for s3 HTMLs (CDN)
  - reused from CMS - route53 hosted zone web.qestapp.net
  - reused from CMS - certificate for web.qestapp.net

## How to deploy Web
We can reuse certificate and hosted zone from CMS of web (its arn is filled at aws/bin/deploy.ts)

0. (if you want reuse certificate and hosted zone) fill variables - `fill variables: hostedZone, hostedZoneId and cdnCertificateArn into aws/bin/deploy.ts`
1. deploy dev (s3, cloudfront) -`yarn deploy:dev`
2. deploy prod (s3, cloudfront) -`yarn deploy:prod`

## Automatically release of web after CMS updates 
- idea: after updates at CMS (texts, images) build, deploy and invalidate CDN (=run Release CICD at TFS)
- flow:
   - when is: deleted, published, unpublished change for text and images is triggered API hook
   - API hook call EP /webhook at backend of strapi, here is implemented controller: `packages/strapi-cms/api/webhook/controllers/webhook.js`
   - there is generated authToken for simple secure EP 
   - controller create POST call into TFS (with credentials from envs) 
   - TFS runs release pipeline
   - note: there is duplication of pipeline for deploy production (because I do not find solution how to trigger explicitly second stage via REST API): https://dev.azure.com/qest/Qest/_release?view=all&_a=releases&definitionId=126
